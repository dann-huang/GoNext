## ‚ú® Features

This project emphasizes real-time interactivity and robust architecture, demonstrating key full-stack capabilities:

* **Full-Stack Architecture:** A high-performance Go backend seamlessly integrated with a modern, reactive Next.js and TypeScript frontend.
* **Real-time Communication:** Custom WebSocket implementations power all interactive features.
* **Live Chat:** Instant, real-time text communication between users.
* **Collaborative Drawing Canvas:** A shared, interactive canvas where multiple users can draw together in real-time.
* **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
* **Containerized Environment:** The entire application stack (frontend, backend, database, cache, proxy) is orchestrated using Docker Compose for consistent local development and production environments.
* **Automated Deployment:** Features a robust CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployment to `daniel-h.ca`.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

LetsGo employs a fully containerized, microservices-oriented architecture. Nginx serves as the entry point, routing requests to the Next.js frontend or the Go backend. The Go backend interacts with PostgreSQL for persistent data and Redis for real-time messaging and caching. All components are defined and orchestrated via Docker Compose.
